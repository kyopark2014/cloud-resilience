# Resilience of Cloud Architecture

## Resience 란

####  Resiliency is Critical
It affects the quality of service your users experience

#### Resiliency is Complex

Like security, it is an end-to-end discipline that must be built in 

Cannot be bolted on later as an after thought

#### Resiliency is a key Cost driver

How many sites, how many data copies - drives cost in multiples (2x, 3x,…)

#### Resiliency in the cloud need not be the same as traditional IT

Need to meet the same business objectives of availability and recovery

There are better ways to provide continuity in the cloud – Use them!

## Reliability를 증가시키는 Design Principles

- Automaticallyrecoverfromfailure

- Testrecoveryprocedures

- Scalehorizontallytoincreaseaggregateworkloadavailability

- Stopguessingcapacity

- Manage change in automation

## Availability 

Availability(가용성)이란 워크로드(Workload)가 사용할수 있는 상태인 시간의 퍼센트입니다.
